Hi! I'm Alessa. Welcome to my online home!
I've created this as a place to save projects.
Non cognitive things I like to do include dance, cooking, walking my dogs and occasionally going on a run or a cycle or a long hike. When I'm not doing that, I'm probably building my MVP for a biotech company I'm working on, or brainstorming randomly cool ideas that come to mind after reading a paper or listening to something interesting. I am a creative in a STEM world, and this is my space to share my creations!
